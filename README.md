Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room. They wanted to created a web based game called Draw It or Lose It. It originally came on an Android app, but they wamted to move to the web based application. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did best comparing the different types of applications and finding inofrmation about those in order to choose the best one for the client.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document allows for the developer to really plan out how the program needs to work so that they can code it that way. i think it is a great idea to get your thoughts on paper and be able to collaborate with others on the plan. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would work on improving the system architecture part. I struggle with that piece of it the most so I think a deep dive into different types of system architexture would aid me in the long run. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted their needs based on the information they gave me on how they want the game to run. This came in to play especially with the images that need to be saved and specifics like that. It is imporant to consider the user's needs because that is who you're developing for and that is where the opinion matters the most. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it piece by piece and trying not to bite off too much at once. When I would look at storage management or memeroy manegement I would try to keep them as separate as possible as to not confuse them. I think I would do this the same way in the future because it really made things easier to handle and understand.
